A modification of the yelpSearch plugin for SiriServerCore.

__

Installation:

1) This is a modification, so replace the yelpSearch/__init__.py file (from https://github.com/jimmykane/SiriServerCorePlugins) with this __init__.py

1b) If using the JimmieKane server, you will want to rename my file to "googlePlacesSearch.py" I think.

2) Currently only responds to "I'm Hungry"

3) To add new commands, (similar to smalltalk.py), copy/paste the code at the bottom (def search_im_hungry.....etc) to a new line

4) Change @register to have new keywords

5) Change name of def from search_im_hungry to whatever you want

6) Change Title = <what to search for>
